# XV6 Project
Here is a brief explanation.

## Phase 2 :
##### Write I/O intensive and process-intensive programs in XV6 and run them together. Compute the turnaround time
##### and response time for your benchmark applications under the default process scheduler.
We put some attributes in the proc struct such as ctime,ltime, first_res_time which are used for the follwoings:
` TurnAroundTime = T(finished) - T(completion) = proc->cltime - proc->ctime `
` ResponseTime = T(finished) - T(scheduled) = proc->ltime - prox->first_res_time `
So we put them in appropriate places in proc.c file and then we wrote a system call that gets these informations from kernel mode to user mode and we used them simply for our tests.
We have two files named io_intensive_test and cpu_intensive_test which the test of each of them is written there.
